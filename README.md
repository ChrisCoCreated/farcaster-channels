# farcaster-channels
A directory for well-known channels across different Farcaster clients

Channels are (currently) a client-only feature, pioneered on the [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/) client. Channels use [FIP-2](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/discussions/71) on the Farcaster protocol, but it's up to clients how to render them.

This repo serves as a public good for mapping well-known channels across Farcaster clients.
